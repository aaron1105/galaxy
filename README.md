# Galaxy Shape Classification
Galaxy shape classification is a fundamental task in astrophysics and requires the analysis of large amounts of astronomical data. Traditional classification techniques rely on  manual feature extraction, which can be laborious and error- prone, and need expert knowledge, to automate and to find the result fast and with high accuracy this project is used.

The data used for galaxy shape classification can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge/data.

The code for the Web App used for Galaxy Shape Classification is made using streamlit library of python. The weights are adjusted such that the training and testing has maximum accuracy.
